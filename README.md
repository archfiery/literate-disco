A playground for implementing some data structures. 
As I am a big fan of C++, I will reference the standard library.
In the introduction of [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html),
we can see that it is a bad idea to translate everything directly from C++ to Go.
However, it is still interesting to explore a bit further -- why not?
Also I notice that the OpenJDK is well written and maintained -- it looks like some model assignment!

Beside the data structure, I am also interested to place some additional implementation
into this repository.
That is to say, I can implement many kinds of `sort` instead of the best one in this
repository.
Therefore, instead of making it a practical library, it is a fun repository to explore the features and design of both Go and C++.
It is also a nice place to recall some lost memory in the university.
